# New V3.6 Parts!

With the V3.6 Update I changed the structure of the folders as well. In this main folder are the common files for all variation of this mod (Z-Plates, Bottom Parts, etc.). You will find all other parts in the corresponding folders.

Note:
- With the V3.6 update you need **two additional M5 nuts** and **one M5x30mm screw** per transmission (so **Dual Z will need twice as much**) and two 3x14mm pins for the new bottom parts (pins are already included in the Powge Kit. You can use the old bottom parts with a M3 screw in the `\V3\_old_V3_parts` folder). Please forgive this extra note, I will update the bom with the new instructions!
- You have to choose between Bottom_20T and Bottom_F623, depending on what you want to use (send `?f623vs20t`on my discord in the #belt-help channel to get a small description about that)
- Dual Z and UltraLow are now also contained in this folder
- MGN: If you want to use MGN, the files are still the same in the V3_MGN folder. You will need these parts in addition.
